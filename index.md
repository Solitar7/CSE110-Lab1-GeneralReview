So I'm trying to get familiar with some `git` codes here, such as:
```
git clone
git branch
git checkout
git add
git commit
git push
```
and also `git config` to set up user.name and user.email in order to push the changes.

With
* `git branch`
- `git checkout`
+ `git config`

can be used in any order some how, we still need to generally

1. `git add`
2. `git commit`
3. `git push`

in order to push changes.

Finally, this is the [link to the review and intro repository](https://github.com/Solitar7/CSE110-Lab1-GeneralReview), 
and [this](https://github.com/Solitar7/CSE110-Lab1-GeneralReview#cse110-lab1-generalreview) is the start of the [README.md](README.md) file.

Confused by task list here: (successfully shown after uploaded to github, but still fail to be shown locally)
- [ ] incomplete task
- [x] complete task

And here are all the screenshots when using git codes in both command line and operating in VS Code directly.
